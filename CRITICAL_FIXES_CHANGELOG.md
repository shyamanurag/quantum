## ⚠️ **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED - IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED**

**IMPORTANT:** A comprehensive system audit has identified critical issues that must be addressed before the system can be considered production-ready for real money trading:

### 🔴 **Authentication & Security Issues**
- Authentication system is DISABLED (`"Authentication system disabled for minimal deployment"`)
- No user sessions or security validation
- API keys stored in plain text in database
- No JWT validation or secure token management
- Frontend can access all APIs without authentication

### 🔴 **Trading System Core Issues**
- Backend health check shows: `"orchestrator_initialized": false, "orchestrator_running": false`
- Trading system is not operational
- No real trade execution capabilities
- Risk management not active

### 🔴 **Database Security Issues**
- API keys stored in plain text
- No encryption for sensitive data
- Missing proper access controls

### ⚠️ **Next Steps Required**
1. Enable SecureAuthManager completely
2. Implement proper JWT token validation on ALL endpoints
3. Encrypt API keys in database storage
4. Add authentication middleware to protect trading endpoints
5. Fix TradingOrchestrator initialization failure
6. Verify all core trading components are loaded
7. Test risk management system activation

**⚠️ WARNING:** The system is NOT ready for real money trading until all critical issues are resolved.
